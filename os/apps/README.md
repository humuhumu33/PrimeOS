# PrimeOS Application Modules

This directory contains top-level application modules built on top of the PrimeOS operating system layer. Applications leverage the OS capabilities such as the model system and logging framework to provide domain-specific functionality.

Each application should follow the standard PrimeOS module pattern and include its own documentation, tests and build configuration.
