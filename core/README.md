# PrimeOS Core

The core package is the foundational layer of PrimeOS, implementing the axiomatic principles that power the entire system. It provides abstract interfaces and base implementations for the fundamental concepts of the Universal Object Representation (UOR) kernel.

## Concept

The core is built upon five interconnected axioms:

1. **Prime Foundation** (from modulus1): All representation derives from prime numbers
2. **Integrity System** (from modulus2): Data carries self-verification via checksums
3. **Unified Execution Model** (from modulus3): Data and operations share a common representation
4. **Stream Processing**: High-throughput primitives for efficient data handling
5. **Band Optimization** (from modulus-bands): Bit-size based optimization for prime operations

These axioms form a complete system for representing, processing, and verifying arbitrary data in a mathematically rigorous way. The core's primary goal is to provide content-agnostic throughput - the ability to process any data type with the same underlying mechanisms, regardless of semantic meaning.

### Mathematical Foundation

The system's foundation is the Prime Number Theorem and its implications for unique factorization. By representing data through prime number relationships, we gain intrinsic properties that enable:

- **Unique Representation**: Every piece of data has a unique prime factorization
- **Self-Verification**: Checksums derived from prime patterns enable data to verify its own integrity
- **Unified Processing**: Common representations allow uniform operations on disparate data types
- **Spectral Transformations**: Number Theoretic Transforms provide lossless domain switching
- **Scale Invariance**: From small integers to astronomical numbers, the same principles apply

## Implementation

The core implementation is divided into five key components:

### 1. Prime Foundation (`prime/`)

The prime foundation provides the mathematical primitives that everything else builds upon:

- Prime number generation, testing, and caching
- Efficient factorization algorithms
- Prime registry with optimized lookup
- Support for arbitrary-precision mathematics

### 2. Integrity System (`integrity/`)

The integrity system ensures data correctness through intrinsic verification:

- Checksum generation based on prime patterns
- Integrity verification mechanisms
- Error detection and correction capabilities
- Resilience against data corruption

### 3. Encoding System (`encoding/`)

The encoding system unifies data and operations:

- Common representation for both data and instructions
- Chunk-based encoding with integrity verification
- Hierarchical composition for nested structures
- Operations as first-class citizens with the same representation as data

### 4. Stream Processing (`stream/`)

The stream processing system enables efficient handling of data flows:

- High-throughput streaming primitives
- Chunked processing for large data sets
- Memory-efficient operations for unlimited-size inputs
- Transformation pipelines for data processing

### 5. Band Optimization (`bands/`)

The band optimization system provides performance across all number ranges:

- Heterodyne Prime-Spectral Filter Bank approach
- Multiple bands optimized for specific bit size ranges
- Automatic selection of optimal processing strategy
- Smooth transitions between adjacent bands

Each component exposes interfaces that higher-level system parts can build upon, while hiding the implementation details. This separation of concerns allows for optimized implementations without affecting the API contract.

## Band-Based Optimization

The band optimization system deserves special mention as it's central to the core's high-performance capabilities. Using a signal processing metaphor, it divides the numerical spectrum into "bands" based on bit size:

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  ULTRABASS  │    BASS     │  MIDRANGE   │ UPPER-MID   │   TREBLE    │ SUPER-TREBLE│ULTRASONIC-1 │ULTRASONIC-2 │
│  (16-32)    │   (33-64)   │  (65-128)   │  (129-256)  │  (257-512)  │ (513-1024)  │ (1025-2048) │ (2049-4096) │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

Each band has tailored parameters:
- **Prime modulus**: Optimized for the specific bit range
- **Processing strategy**: From direct computation to distributed streaming
- **Window functions**: Specialized spectral characteristics
- **Lattice configurations**: Dimensionality matched to complexity

This approach enables optimal performance regardless of number size, with smooth transitions between bands at boundary conditions.

## Integration Points

The core package provides the following key integration points for higher-level components:

1. **Registry Factory**: Creates the appropriate prime registry based on requirements
2. **Integrity System**: Provides verification and error detection capabilities
3. **Encoder Interface**: Enables consistent data and operation encoding
4. **Stream Processors**: Handles efficient data flow processing
5. **Band Optimizers**: Ensures optimal performance across number ranges

## Performance Characteristics

The core is designed with performance as a primary concern:

- **Scalability**: From small to astronomical numbers without performance cliffs
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stream processing prevents excessive memory usage
- **Throughput Optimization**: Tailored strategies for each bit size range
- **Acceleration Factors**: Up to 14× faster than naive implementations in optimal bands
- **Parallelization**: Automatic parallelization for suitable operations

## Current Status

The core implementation is in the initial phase, with interfaces defined based on the original UOR kernel modules. Implementation will proceed with:

1. Establishing abstract interfaces for each component
2. Implementing minimal functional versions of each component
3. Optimizing critical paths for performance
4. Adding comprehensive testing

## Design Principles

Throughout the implementation, the core adheres to these design principles:

- **Interface-First Design**: Clear interfaces before implementation details
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Composability**: Components can be combined in flexible ways
- **Progressive Optimization**: Basic functionality first, then progressive performance improvements
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain API stability while improving implementations
